# Level 1: Capstone project 3

This application uses external data sources and python logic to help create a useful task management application for project managers.

Users will be able to create team members with there credentials and assign different tasks to the individuals in the team. 
These details will be updated and stored in txt files for use else where if necessary and as a way of data storage.

*Later on we will build on this project to incorporate more functionality for each team member as well as the team leaders.*
